What began as a small tavern serving local foresters and travelers has evolved into one of the region's most beloved restaurants, while maintaining its authentic charm and traditional recipes passed down through generations."

          content="Our location in the Black Forest isn't just about scenery â€“ it's integral to our cuisine. We source our ingredients from local farmers and producers, including wild mushrooms, berries, and herbs from the forest itself. Our smoked ham and trout are prepared using traditional Black Forest methods, and our water comes from natural mountain springs."
